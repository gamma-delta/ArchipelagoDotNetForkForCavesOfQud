TThis directory is included (with some pruning) from:

https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago.MultiClient.Net

version 6.3.0
(because that was the main at the time)

The `pkarc-edits` branch has the commits / diffs required to make it
work under Caves of Qud.

I've never seriously used submodules before so I hope this works.
